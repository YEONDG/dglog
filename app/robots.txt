# Allow all crawlers full access by default
User-agent: *
Allow: /

# Optionally, you can disallow specific paths if they exist and should not be crawled.
# For example, if you had an admin area:
# Disallow: /admin/
# Or API routes that don't need to be indexed:
# Disallow: /api/

# Allow Googlebot (and Googlebot-Image by inheritance) to crawl images.
# By removing the specific Disallow rules for images, they become allowed due to "Allow: /" above.

# Point crawlers to the sitemap
